\title{Quickly plot a list of offtake models}
\usage{
plot_offtake(offtake, ages, title = title)
}
\arguments{
\item{offtake}{a list of vectors with numbers corresponding the offtake probabilities by age}

\item{ages}{a vector of numbers corresponding to the age of an animal. Length should be equal to length of each offtake model}

\item{title}{a string providing the title for the graph}
}
\value{
a line graph with offtake models colored by strategy.
