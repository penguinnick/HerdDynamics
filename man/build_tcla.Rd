\title{Build age-class and sex structured table. The output table (using mmage naming convention tcla) is the first step for herd projection.}
\usage{
build_tcla(female.ages, male.ages, nbphase)
}
\arguments{
\item{female.ages}{a vector of numbers containing the length of age classes in years for females where c(0.5, 1, 1) corresponds to 6 months, 1 year, 2 years of age. If terminal age is not Inf, a truncated model will be produced.}

\item{male.ages}{a vector of numbers containing the length of age classes in years for males where c(0.5, 1, 1) corresponds to 6 months, 1 year, 2 years of age. If terminal age is not Inf, a truncated model will be produced.}

\item{nbphase}{an integer by which age classes will be multiplied. Set nbphase to 1 to model population growth by year, set to 12 to model monthly growth}
}
\value{
data.frame created with fclass function (see mmage package)
}
